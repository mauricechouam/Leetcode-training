## 1)  Reverse String
A function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## 2)   Reverse Integer
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows. Constraints: -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
