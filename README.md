## 1) [Reverse String ](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Reverse%20String/code.js)
A function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## 2)[Reverse Interger](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Reverse%20Interger/code.js)
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows. Constraints: -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321

## 3)[Non-Decreasing Array](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Non-Decreasing%20Array/code.js)
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

## 4)[Missing Number](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Missing%20Number/code.js)
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
* Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## 5)[Single Number](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Reverse%20Words%20in%20a%20String%20III/code.js)
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
## 6)[Valid Anagram](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Valid%20Anagram/code.js)
Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

## 7) [Set Mismatch](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Set%20Mismatch/code.js)
The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
Note:
The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
The given array's numbers won't have any order.

## 8) [Reverse Words in a String III](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Set%20Mismatch/code.js)
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

## 9) [Jump Game](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Jump%20Game/code.js)
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.


## 10) [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Search%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array/code.js)
You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.
Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1


## 11) [Shuffle the Array](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Shuffle%20the%20Array/code.js)
Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

## 12) [the Greatest Number of Candies](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Greatest%20Number%20of%20Candies/code.js)
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.
For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
Example 1
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

## 13) [Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Intersection%20of%20Two%20Arrays%20II/code.js)
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Note:
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.

## 14) [Height Checker](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Height%20Checker/code.js)
Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.
Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.
Example 1:
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
Example 2:
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5

## 15) [Rotate Array](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Rotate%20Array/code.js)
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Follow up:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

## 16) [Pow(x, n)](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Pow(x%2C%20n)/code.js)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e. xn).
Example 1:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100

## 17) [1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/1-bit%20and%202-bit%20Characters/code.js)
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.
Example 1:
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

## 18) [Defuse the Bomb](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Defuse%20the%20Bomb/code.js)
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.
To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.
If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
Example 1:
Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

## 19) [Defuse the Bomb](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Defuse%20the%20Bomb/code.js)
You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.
Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.
Example 1:
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 
-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3
There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
