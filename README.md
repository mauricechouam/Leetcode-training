## 1) ![Reverse String ](https://github.com/mauricechouam/Leetcode-training/blob/main/Reverse%20String/code.js)
A function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## 2)   Reverse Integer
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows. Constraints: -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321

## 3) Non-decreasing Array
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

## 4) Missing Number
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
* Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## 5) Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
## 6) Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

## 7) Set Mismatch
The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
Note:
The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
The given array's numbers won't have any order.
